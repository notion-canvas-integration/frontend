    <h1>C2N Terms of Use</h1>
    <p>
        There's not much that we offer, so there's not much that we have to restrict. However, there are some terms and conditions to using our service:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <i>Without contacting us first (e.g for bug testing purposes)...</i>
        <li>You must not make any attempt to damage the service or reduce its availability for others.</li>
        <li>You must not make any attempt to bypass the security of the platform.</li>
        <br>

        <i>Never...</i>
        <li>Attempt to bypass the rate limiting</li>
        <li>Attempt to access another person's database.</li>
        <br>

        This service is offered with no uptime guarantee, not even a hint of one. It may go down at any time. It should not be relied on. Although the API is simple to reverse-engineer and you are free to use it (within the rate limit), you should not rely on its availability.

    </ul>
