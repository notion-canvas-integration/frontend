    <h1>C2N Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
        We know you care about your privacy. We care about it too. Let's make this quick:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not knowingly collect personal information.</li>
        <li>Canvas tokens are not stored, and can easily be set to expire.</li>
        <li>The Notion OAuth token is stored in the local storage on your device.</li>
        <li>We will only use the Notion API to access the tools you've integrated it with, and only for the reasons that we clearly list on each tool's page.</li>
        <li>We may collect analytics data from this website (e.g from Google Analytics), but not ever from the contents of your Notion pages - those are not read, only written to.</li>
        <li>If you want to verify this or run your own version, our source code is public <a href="https://github.com/notion-canvas-integration">here</a>.</li>
    </ul>
